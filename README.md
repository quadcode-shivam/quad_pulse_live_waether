# Quad Pulse Live Weather App

This project is a simple live weather application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**. The app allows users to check the current weather by entering a city name, and it displays the weather conditions, temperature, and other relevant details. It fetches real-time data from a weather API.

## Features

- **Real-Time Weather Data**: Fetches live weather information for any city worldwide.
- **User Interface**: Clean and simple user interface with weather details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and description.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to work well on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **API Integration**: Integrates with a weather API (such as OpenWeatherMap) to fetch live weather information.
- **Error Handling**: Displays error messages if the city name is invalid or the API call fails.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
- **API**: OpenWeatherMap API (or any similar weather API for real-time weather data)
- **Responsive Design**: CSS for responsive design to ensure compatibility across different devices (using media queries).
